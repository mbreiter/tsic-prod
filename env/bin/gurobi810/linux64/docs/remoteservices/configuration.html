Configuration
</H3>

<P>
The Remote Services agent has a number of configuration properties
that affect its behavior.  These can be controlled using a
<TT>grb_rs.cnf</TT> configuration file.  By default, this file must be
located in the same directory as the <TT>grb_rs</TT> executable.  The
installation package includes a predefined configuration file that can
be used as a starting point (<TT>&lt;installdir&gt;/bin/grb_rs.cnf</TT>).

<P>
You can edit the default configuraton file or override it as <TT>grb_rs</TT> will
use the following precedence rules:

<UL>
<LI>command line flag <TT>--config</TT>
</LI>
<LI>current directory
</LI>
<LI>shared directory (<TT>C:&#92;gurobi</TT>, <TT>/opt/gurobi</TT>, <TT>/Library/gurobi</TT> depending on windows, linux and mac platforms respectively)
</LI>
<LI>directory where <TT>grb_rs</TT> is located
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The configuration file contains a list of properties of the form
<TT>PROPERTY=value</TT>.  Lines that begin with the # symbol are
treated as comments and are ignored.  Here is an example:

<PRE>
# grb_rs.cnf configuration file
PASSWORD=abcd1234
ADMINPASSWORD=1234abcd
</PRE>
While you could create this file from scratch, we recommend you start
with the version of this file that is included with the product and
modify it instead.

<P>
Examples of properties that are configured through this file are
client and administrator passwords, communication options, and job
processing options.  The command <TT>grb_rs properties</TT> lists all
the available properties, the default values, and provides
documentation for each.  Some properties can be overriden on the
command line of <TT>grb_rs</TT>; the name of the command-line flag you
would use to do so is provided as well.

<P>
Some properties are important and must be changed for a production deployment:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>HOSTNAME</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This must be the DNS name of the node that can be resolved
from the other nodes or the clients in your network. grb_rs tries to get a reasonable
default value, but this value may still not be resolved by clients and could
generate connection errors. It this case, you need to override this name in the configuration
file with a fully qualified name of your node, for example:

<PRE>
HOSTNAME=server1
</PRE>
If the names cannot be resolved by clients, another option is to use IP addresses directly,
in this case set this property to the IP address of the node.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CLUSTER_TOKEN</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The token is a private key that enables different
  nodes to join the same cluster.  All nodes of a cluster must have
  the same token.  We recommended that you generate a brand new token
  when you set up your cluster.  The <TT>grb_rs token</TT> command
  will generate a random token, which you can copy into
  the configuration file.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>PASSWORD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the password that clients must supply in order
  to access the cluster.  It can be stored in clear text or hashed.
  We recommended that you create your own password, and that you
  store it in hashed form.  You can use the <TT>grb_rs hash</TT> command
  to compute the hashed value for your chosen password.

<PRE>
grb_rs hash newpass
$$ppEieKZExlBR-pCSUMlmc4oWlG8nZsUOE2IM0hJbzsmV_Yjj
</PRE>
Then copy and paste the value in the configuration file:

<PRE>
PASSWORD=$$ppEieKZExlBR-pCSUMlmc4oWlG8nZsUOE2IM0hJbzsmV_Yjj
</PRE>

<P>
The default password is <TT>pass</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>ADMINPASSWORD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the password that clients must supply in
  order to run restricted administrative job commands.  It can be
  stored in clear text or hashed.  We recommended that you create your
  own password, and that you store it in hashed form.  You can use the
  <TT>grb_rs hash</TT> command to compute the hashed value for your
  chosen password.  The default password is <TT>admin</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CLUSTER_ADMINPASSWORD</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the password that clients must
  supply in order to run restricted administrative cluster commands.
  It can be stored in clear text or hashed.  We recommended that you
  create your own password, and that you store it in hashed form.  You
  can use the <TT>grb_rs hash</TT> command to compute the hashed value
  for your chosen password.  The default password is <TT>cluster</TT>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>JOBLIMIT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This property sets the maximum number of jobs that
  can run concurrently when using Compute Server on a specific node.
  The limit can be
  changed on a running cluster using the <TT>grbcluster config</TT>
  command, in which case the new value will persist and the value in
  the configuration file will be ignored from that point on (even
  if you stop and restart the cluster).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>HARDJOBLIMIT</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Certain jobs (those with priority 100) are allowed
to ignore the JOBLIMIT, but they aren't allowed to ignore this limit.
Client requests beyond this limit are queued. This limit is set to 0
by default which means that it is disabled.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>CLIENT_DETAILS_ADMIN</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When a job is submitted, the client hostname, IP,
and process ID are recorded. By default, this information is displayed to
any user running the command line tool <TT>grbcluster</TT> or the REST API.
If this property is set to <TT>true</TT>, only the administrator will be able
to access this information.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>USERNAME_ADMIN</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When a job is submitted, the client process
username is recorded. By default, this information is displayed to
any user running the command line tool <TT>grbcluster</TT> or the REST API.
If this property is set to <TT>true</TT>, only the administrator will be able
to access this information.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The configuration file is only read once, when <TT>grb_rs</TT> first
starts.  Subsequent changes to the file won't affect parameter values
on a running server.
