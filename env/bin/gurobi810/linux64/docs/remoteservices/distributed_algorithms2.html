Distributed Algorithms</A>
</H2>

<P>
Gurobi Remote Services allow you to perform distributed optimization.
All you need is a cluster with more than one node.  The nodes can be
either Compute Server or distributed worker nodes.  Ideally these
nodes should all give very similar performance.  Identical performance
is best, especially for distributed tuning, but small variations in
performance won't hurt overall results too much.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Choosing an Appropriate Cluster</SPAN>

<P>
Before launching a distributed optimization job, you should
run the <TT>grbcluster nodes</TT> command to make sure the
cluster contains more than one live machine:

<PRE>
&gt; grbcluster nodes --server=server1:port --password=pass
</PRE>

<P>
If you see multiple live nodes, then that cluster is good to go:

<PRE>
ADDRESS       STATUS TYPE    LICENSE #Q #R JL IDLE  %MEM  %CPU
server1:61000 ALIVE  COMPUTE VALID   0  0  1  43m0s 42.67 2.53
server2:61000 ALIVE  WORKER  N/A     0  0  1  &lt;1s   42.67 1.76
</PRE>

<P>
We should reiterate a point that was raised earlier: you do not need a
Gurobi license to run Gurobi Remote Services on a machine.  While some
services are only available with a license, any machine that is
running Gurobi Remote Services will provide the Distributed Worker
service.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Running A Distributed Algorithm</SPAN>

<P>
Running a distributed algorithm is simply a matter of setting the
appropriate Gurobi parameter.  Gurobi supports distributed MIP,
concurrent LP and MIP, and distributed tuning.  These are controlled
with three parameters: <TT>DistributedMIPJobs</TT>,
<TT>ConcurrentJobs</TT>, and <TT>TuneJobs</TT>, respectively.  These
parameters indicate how many distinct distributed worker jobs you
would like to start.  Keep in mind that the initial Compute Server job
will act as the first worker.

<P>
To give an example, if you have a cluster consisting of two machines
(<TT>server1</TT> and <TT>server2</TT>), and if you set <TT>TuneJobs</TT> to
2 in <TT>grbtune</TT>...

<PRE>
&gt; grbtune --server=server1:61000 --password=passwd TuneJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see output that looks like the following...

<PRE>
Capacity available on 'server1:61000' - connecting...
...
Using Compute Server as first worker
Started distributed worker on server2:61000

Distributed tuning: launched 2 distributed worker jobs
</PRE>
This output indicates that two worker jobs have been launched, one on
machine <TT>server1</TT> and the other on machine <TT>server2</TT>.  These
two jobs will continue to run until your tuning run completes.

<P>
Similarly, if you launch distributed MIP...

<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl --server=server1:61000 --password=passwd DistributedMIPJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see the following output in the log...

<PRE>
Using Compute Server as first worker
Started distributed worker on server2:61000

Distributed MIP job count: 2
</PRE>

<P>
Note that distributed workers are allocated on a first-come,
first-served basis, so if multiple users are sharing a cluster, you
should be prepared for the possibility that some or all of your
distributed workers may be busy when you request them.  Your program
will grab as many as it can, up to the requested count.  If none are
available, it will return an error.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Using a Separate Manager</SPAN>

<P>
While distributed workers always need to be part of a Remote Services
cluster, note that the manager itself does not.  Any machine that is
licensed to run distributed algorithms can act as the manager.  You
simply need to set <TT>WorkerPool</TT> and <TT>WorkerPassword</TT>
parameters to point to the Remote Services cluster that contains your
distributed workers.  To give an example:

<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl WorkerPool=server1:61000 WorkerPassword=passwd DistributedMIPJobs=2 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...you should see the following output in the log...

<PRE>
Started distributed worker on server1:61000
Started distributed worker on server2:61000

Distributed MIP job count: 2
</PRE>
In this case, the distributed computation is managed by the machine
where you launched this command, and the two distributed workers come
from your Remote Services cluster.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Compute Server Considerations</SPAN>

<P>
As noted earlier,
<A HREF="compute_server.html#sec:ComputeServer">Gurobi Compute Servers</A>,
can be used for distributed
optimization as well.  Compute Servers offer a lot more flexibility
than distributed workers, though, so they require a bit of additional
explanation.

<P>
The first point you should be aware of is that one Compute Server node
can actually host multiple distributed worker jobs.  Compute Server
nodes allow you to set a limit on the number of jobs that can run
simultaneously.  Each of those jobs can be a distributed worker.  For
example, if you have a cluster that contains a pair of Compute Server
nodes, each with a job limit of 2, then issuing the command...

<PRE>
&gt; gurobi_cl --server=server1:61000 --password=passwd DistributedMIPJobs=3 misc07.mps
</PRE>
...would produce the following output...

<PRE>
Capacity available on 'server1:61000' - connecting...
...
Using Compute Server as first worker
Started distributed worker on server2:61000
Started distributed worker on server1:61000
</PRE>
Compute Server assigns a new job to the machine with the most
available capacity, so assuming that the two servers are otherwise
idle, the first distributed worker job would be assigned to
<TT>server1</TT>, the second to <TT>server2</TT>, and the third to
<TT>server1</TT>.
