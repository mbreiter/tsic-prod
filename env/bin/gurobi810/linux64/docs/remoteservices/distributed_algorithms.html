Distributed Algorithms
</H2>

<P>
As noted earlier, Gurobi Optimizer implements a number of distributed algorithms that
allow you to use multiple machines to solve a problem faster.
Available distributed algorithms are:

<UL>
<LI><B>A distributed MIP solver</B>, which allows you to
  divide the work of solving a single MIP model among multiple
  machines.  A manager machine passes problem data to a
  set of worker machines in order to coordinate the overall solution
  process.
</LI>
<LI><B>A distributed concurrent solver</B>, which allows you to use
  multiple machines to solve an LP or MIP model.  Unlike the
  distributed MIP solver, the concurrent solver doesn't divide the
  work among machines.  Instead, each machine uses a different
  strategy to solve the whole problem, with the hope that one strategy
  will be particularly effective and will finish much earlier than the
  others.  For some problems, this concurrent approach can be more
  effective than attempting to divide up the work.
</LI>
<LI><B>Distributed parameter tuning</B>, which automatically
  searches for parameter settings that improve performance on your
  optimization model (or set of models).  Tuning solves your model(s)
  with a variety of parameter settings, measuring the performance
  obtained by each set, and then uses the results to identify the settings
  that produce the best overall performance.  The distributed version of
  tuning performs these trials on multiple machines, which makes the overall
  tuning process run much faster.
</LI>
</UL>
These distributed algorithms are designed to be nearly transparent to
the user.  The user simply modifies a few parameters, and the work of
distributing the computation among multiple machines is handled behind
the scenes by the Gurobi library.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Distributed Workers and the Distributed Manager</SPAN>

<P>
Running distributed algorithms requires several machines.  One acts as
the manager, coordinating the activities of the set of machines.  The
others act as workers, receiving tasks from the manager.  The manager
typically acts as a worker itself, although not always.  More machines
generally produce better performance, although the marginal benefit of
an additional machine typically falls off as you add more.

<P>
As we'll discuss <A HREF="compute_servers_and_distri.html#sec:RSNodeTypes">shortly</A>, distributed
workers do not require Gurobi licenses.  You can add any machine to a
Remote Services cluster to act as a distributed worker.  The manager
does require a distributed algorithm license (you'll see a
<TT>DISTRIBUTED=</TT> line in your license file if distributed
algorithms are enabled).

<P>
A typical distributed optimization will look like the following, with
all machines belonging to the same Remote Services cluster:

 SRC="./distributed2.png"
 ALT="Image distributed2">
</DIV>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
</DIV>
The workload associated with managing distributed algorithms is quite
light, so a machine can handle both the manager and worker roles
without degrading performance.

<P>
Another option is to use a machine outside of your Remote Services
cluster as the manager:

<IMG
  WIDTH="435" HEIGHT="271" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="./distributed.png"
 ALT="Image distributed">
</DIV>
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
</DIV>

<P>
Note that we only allow a machine to act as manager for a single
distributed job.  If you want to run multiple distributed jobs
simultaneously, you'll need multiple manager machines.
