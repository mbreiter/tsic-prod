Compute Servers and Distributed Workers
</H3>

<P>
A Remote Services cluster is a collection of nodes of two different
types:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>COMPUTE</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A Compute Server node supports the offloading of
  optimization jobs.  Features include load balancing, queueing and
  concurrent execution of jobs. A Compute Server license is required
  on the node.  A Compute Server node can also act as a distributed
  worker.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>WORKER</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A distributed worker node can be used to execute part of
  a distributed algorithm.  A license is not necessary to run a
  distributed worker, because it is always used in conjunction with a
  manager (another node or a client program) that requires a license.
  A distributed worker node can only be used by one manager at a time
  (i.e., the job limit is always set to 1).

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
By default, <TT>grb_rs</TT> will try to start a node in Compute Server mode and
the node license status will be <TT>INVALID</TT> if no license is found.
In order to start a distributed
worker, you need to set the <TT>WORKER</TT> property in the
<TT>grb_rs.cnf</TT> configuration file (or the <TT>--worker</TT>
command-line flag):

<PRE>
WORKER=true
</PRE>

<P>
Once you form your cluster, the node type will be displayed in the
<TT>TYPE</TT> column of the output of <TT>grbcluster nodes</TT>:

<PRE>
&gt; grbcluster --server=server1 --password=pass nodes --long

</PRE>

<P>
The node type cannot be changed once <TT>grb_rs</TT> has started. If you
wish to change the node type, you need to stop the node, change the
configuration, and restart the node. You may have to update your
license as well.

<P>
<BIG CLASS="LARGE"><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Distributed Optimization</SPAN></BIG>

<P>
When using distributed optimization, distributed workers are
controlled by a manager. There are two ways to set up the manager:

<UL>
<LI>The manager can be a job running on a Compute Server.  In this
  case, the manager job is first submitted to the cluster and executes
  on one of the <TT>COMPUTE</TT> nodes as usual.  When this job starts,
  it will also request some number of workers (see
  parameters <TT>DistributedMIPJobs</TT>, <TT>ConcurrentJobs</TT>, or
  <TT>TuneJobs</TT>).  The first choice will be <TT>WORKER</TT> nodes.  If
  not enough are available, it will use <TT>COMPUTE</TT> nodes.  The
  workload associated with managing the distributed algorithm is quite
  light, so the initial job will act as both the manager and the first
  worker.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The manager can be the client program itself.  The manager does
  not participate in the distributed optimization. It simply
  coordinates the efforts of the distributed workers.  The manager
  will request distributed workers (using the <TT>WorkerPool</TT>
  parameter), and the cluster will first
  select the <TT>WORKER</TT> nodes then, if not enough are available, it
  will use <TT>COMPUTE</TT> nodes as well.
</LI>
</UL>
In both cases, the machine where the manager runs must be licensed to
run distributed algorithms (you should see a <TT>DISTRIBUTED=</TT> line
in your license file).

<P>
It is typically better to use the Compute Server itself as the
distributed manager, rather than the client machine. This is
particularly true if the Compute Server and the workers are physically
close to each other, but physically distant from the client
machine. In a typical environment, the client machine will offload the
Gurobi computations onto the Compute Server, and the Compute Server
will then act as the manager for the distributed computation.

<P>
